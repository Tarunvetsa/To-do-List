# To-do-List
Creating todo list using react


This project is to create basic Todo list.
To run this open the folder in vscode and run the command npm i which will install all dependency node modules.

After then run npm run dev then we can see the Todolist in browser. Even though we close it now and reopens after some long time the data will be restored.
